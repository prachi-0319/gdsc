GenAI-Powered Financial Assistant for Better Investing Decisions
GenAI based financial assistant that allows people to ask the most basic questions around investing, but also allows them to find products to invest in. Financial literacy levels are extremely low in India, and while there's a growing number of investors in the market, there's little to no guidance given to them. We're working to bridge that divide and help people invest better. The the 100s of millions of investors coming in to the market, there's only one solution to address the problem and that is using AI. The scale of users simply cannot be addressed through manual means. We are building a GenAI based solution to allow people to have a conversation about their financial needs and be better informed while making a decision.
